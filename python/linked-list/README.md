# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes as discussed in the previous chapter.

## Testing

-   [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.
-   [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.
-   [x] Can properly insert into the linked list.
-   [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.
-   [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.
-   [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist.
-   [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list.

**LinkedList.insert()**:

#### Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

**LinkedList.includes()** :

#### Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
